# VIRTUAL-PET
Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to them. Maybe you just aren't allowed one in your flat.

To help you solve this problem  we are going to  our own  Javascript Pets.

Javascript pets are great because they can do exactly the same things normal pets would do and they won't even ðŸ’©(lol).

# OUR JAVASCRIP PETS FEATURES
Our Javascript pets will have their name , they will get older and as they get older they will get hungrier and less fit.

You will be able to walk your pet to increase it's fitness, you can feed them to decrease their hunger.

You will be able to talk to your pet to see if needs feeding or walking, if your pet gets too hungry or unfit or even if it gets to  30 days old it will DIE ðŸ’€.
